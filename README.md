# energizei-server

> App that runs the AC controller dashboard and login screen

This is a old project. Made when I was learning Node.js and MongoDB for the first time. 

The objective is create an instance of a mongoDB server and to store objects on it whenever an IoT device sent data about the current weather or the received infrared command. The final goal would be to create a full-fledged dashboard to manage all the devices and log data using charts.
